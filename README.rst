Abstract
--------

‘miR2Disease’, a manually curated database, aims at providing a comprehensive resource of microRNA deregulation in
various human diseases. The current version of miR2Disease documents 1939 curated relationships between 299 human
microRNAs and 94 human diseases by reviewing more than 600 published papers. Around one-seventh of the microRNA–disease
relationships represent the pathogenic roles of deregulated microRNA in human disease. Each entry in the miR2Disease
contains detailed information on a microRNA–disease relationship, including a microRNA ID, the disease name, a brief
description of the microRNA–disease relationship, an expression pattern of the microRNA, the detection method for
microRNA expression, experimentally verified target gene(s) of the microRNA and a literature reference. miR2Disease
provides a user-friendly interface for a convenient retrieval of each entry by microRNA ID, disease name, or target gene.
In addition, miR2Disease offers a submission page that allows researchers to submit established microRNA–disease
relationships that are not documented. Once approved by the submission review committee, the submitted records will be
included in the database. miR2Disease is freely available at http://www.miR2Disease.org.
